# This is a simple set of apps taking the users input of two numbers and either subtracting, adding, multiplying, and dividing.
# Each application is isolated so you can run any one independent of the other.
# Result of each mathematical operation is displayed as a sentence describing what was done in the computing of the operation.
## Order of my process was:
1. Write and test functions in test.js
2. Check these in test.html.
3. Write the functions that will act as the applications that will calculate the math in calc.js.
4. Call the functions from calc.js in app.js.
5. Write my html to have a UI and link to the javascript in calc.js and app.js.
