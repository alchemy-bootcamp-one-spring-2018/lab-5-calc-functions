Hi! This is Robert Thompsons lab 5!
This lab functions as a basic calculator! It has functionality that includes:
1. Addition
1. Subtraction
1. Multiplication
1. Division
1. Finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle
1. Whether or not a number is even or odd
1. Whether or not a number is prime

I made this program doing a test development model, where I tested theoretical functions before they even existed, and then wrote code to fill in those tests.
