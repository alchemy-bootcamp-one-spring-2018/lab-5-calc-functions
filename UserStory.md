US: 
    As a User, I need a web app that i can run math functions, like add, subtract, divide, multiply. 

AC:
    1. Should have two input boxes (one for each number). 

    2. Should have separate  buttons for "Add", "Subtract", "Divide", "Multiply", "Modulus".  

    3. It should display the result once button is pressed.
